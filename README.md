# Bomberman

I kinda forgot about this folder. :( I've Should have written comments here, so you could have seen it in commits.

Notes about map:
Bombs are not proportional and it let you go pass them. I will not change that because it can be done leater. Moreover possibity of passing bombs is intresting and might be quite fun. Have to check that leater.

Notes obout SpawnActorComponent:
I created it specialy for creating Actors in world.I wanted this to be a component because it's reusable and I will need similar functionality with pickups.

I am trying to put all my #include in .cpp files so it will not be loaded when I put reference to .h file
